# Fluxmatix.Mobile

Fluxmatix.Mobile is a Xamarin library (pcl) is primarily a dependency for (other repos), providing models, abstractions and a few common non-platform specific tools.

What's in there:

  * An abstraction for a cross platform caching system for complex data object (POCO's) and user settings
  * An caching implementation using Xamarin's own cross platform SettingsPlugin 
  * Models and abstractions
  * An attempt to create a more simple approach to working with time zone's in c# (experimental!)

  Have a look at [Fluxmatix.Mobile.iOS](https://github.com/Corstiaan84/Fluxmatix.Mobile.iOS) for some Xamarin.iOS specific ViewControllers, Views and utilities.
